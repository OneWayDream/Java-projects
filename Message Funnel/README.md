# Message Funnel

> So. Suppose you have several chatbots in different messengers.
> You may be too lazy to go into each of them to respond to end users.
>  That's exactly the problem our app solves.

> There's a main bot, there's a set of dependent bots. 
> The owner sits on the main bot, reading and responding to the messages sent to him by the dependent bots.

> At the moment, the main bot is the Discord Bot and the dependent bot is Telegram.

> The part for communication between bots is implemented through Java Sockets.

> The main part related to the Discord bot was done by [this person][Samurai19-url]
> 
> The main part related to the Telegram bot was done by [this person][KoaLa1101-url]
