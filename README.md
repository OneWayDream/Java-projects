## Entity Manager

> Simple Entity Manager realisation. I tried to use a lot of interfaces from javax.persistance without any tips from internet. Anyway, it was good experience to work with reflection.

## Message Funnel

> Not big back-end project, done during summer practice in SimbirSoft company. Main idea of this project - centralize the functionality of several bots in one.

## Minion Valuation

> My university semester work of Second Semester 😐, its just addition site for Minecraft Hypixel Skyblock to facilitate minion's profit calculation.

## Rarriate

> Also university semester work of Second Semester, it is simple weird 2D game.

## Socket Chat

> Small application, contains client and server classes for chating.
