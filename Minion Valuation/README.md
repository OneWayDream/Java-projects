# Minion Valuation

> Minion Valuation - it is a website utility for Skyblock on the Minecraft Hypixel server. The main functionality is to calculate income per minion depending on improvements, fuel and so on.

* ##### Since this project was written as a university, for the tick here is all the functionality of working with the user - registration, authorization and so on. It doesn't make sense, but it works!

* ##### Unfortunately (or not), interest in this game has been lost, so there will be no further development of this site.

- #### Servlet Version, I strongly advise you to look only if you are interested in servlets. Everything done there is quite primitive. Moreover, the storage of entities in the database is horrible

- #### The Spring Version looks better. This is a variant of this project on Spring MVC without using Spring Boot dependencies.
