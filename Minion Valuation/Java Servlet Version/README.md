# Minion-Valuation

Minion-Valuation is a project carried out as a semester work on computer science.
The main functionality is a utility for Skyblock mode of Hypixel server of Minecraft game.  The site calculates the possible profit for different minions (entities in the game that extract resources for the player without his direct intervention) with various installed improvements and fuel based on the prices of game entities (nps) and the bazaar (a platform where prices and demand are formally controlled by players. In order to ensure that the prices are always up to date, the server updates the Hypixel key API every 20 minutes).
